# UFW can work managing both IPV4 addresses, enabled by default, and IPV6 if necessary. If you need to also # enable IPV6, modify this option from the file "/ etc / default / ufw". 

# In order to apply this change, open the file with the nano editor:
# Then make sure the value of IPV6 is yes. It should look like this:
# IPV6=yes
sudo nano /etc/default/ufw

# To block any form of communication TOWARDS the server
sudo ufw default deny incoming

# To allow any form of outgoing communication FROM the server
sudo ufw default allow outgoing

# To configure your server to allow incoming SSH connections, you can use this command:
sudo ufw allow ssh
# or sudo ufw allow 22

# To configure your server to allow incoming HTTP connections, you can use this command:
sudo ufw allow 80
# sudo ufw allow http

# To configure your server to allow incoming HTTPS connections, you can use this command:
sudo ufw allow 443
# sudo ufw allow https
